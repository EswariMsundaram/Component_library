##Reflections##

**How did you handle optional props in your components?**
Extracted the values from props using a local variable and by exporting the interface and a components to the parent App.tsx


**What considerations did you make when designing the component interfaces?**
The main consideration while designing the component is in which order the data should be displayed in the browser and how. Which elements to use and how the data can be fetched.

**How did you ensure type safety across your components?**
Used Type Annotation, interfaces type, tsconfig.json that checks type strictly.

**What challenges did you face when implementing component composition?**

Implementing the props was little confusing initially how and where to use. Then going through the lessons, examples and the activity we worked in class was really helpful to implement this lab and also styling userprofile card was also challenging to align the contents in the card. With lot of practicing and trying different things, made this lab successful.
